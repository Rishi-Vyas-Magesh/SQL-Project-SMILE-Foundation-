# SQL-Project-SMILE-Foundation-

As part of my Business Analytics course, SQL was taught and I made a project to showcase my Creation, Population and Querying skills. SMILE is a Real foundation that exists. I understood its business operations and tried to come up with an ER (Entity Relationship) diagram. Based on that, I generated my own tables and its columns,primary and foreign keys. I also populated them with AI.
Finally, I formulated my own queries and demonstrated it to my mentor as proof or working RDBMS.

I have attached the Word file and .SQL file used for population and schema of tables I created. Also, the Queries I ran. This was executed in 'phpmyadmin' port 80 in my local device.
